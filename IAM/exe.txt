1. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a security system that requires more 
   than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials 
   to verify the userâ€™s identity for a login or other transaction.

2. An instance profile is a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role 
   information to an EC2 instance when the instance starts. When you create an IAM 
   role using the console, the console creates an instance profile automatically and 
   gives it the same name as the role it corresponds to.If you use the AWS CLI to create a role, 
   you create the role and instance profile as separate actions, and you might give them different 
   names. To launch an instance with an IAM role, you specify the name of its instance profile. 
   When you launch an instance using the Amazon EC2 console, you can select a role to associate with the instance.

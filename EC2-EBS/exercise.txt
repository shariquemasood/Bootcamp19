1. HVM: The hardware virtual machine (HVM) are fully virtualized. 
   It means that the VMs running on top of their hypervisors are 
   not aware that they are sharing processing time with other clients on the same hardware.

   PVM: Paravirtual guests can run on host hardware that does not have explicit support 
   for virtualization, but they cannot take advantage of special hardware extensions such 
   as enhanced networking or GPU processing. Historically, PV guests had better performance 
   than HVM guests in many cases, but because of enhancements in HVM virtualization and the 
   availability of PV drivers for HVM AMIs, this is no longer true.

2. Firt check the security group that allow inbound connection
   Second Network ACL rule that allow inbound and outbount rule for traffic
   Third Subnet(in which you launched your instance)  should associate with route table 
   Four Check ssh port is open or not in your security groups
   Five Try to check ping your server to check server is reachable or not.

3. aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0ac019f4fcb7cb7e6 --count 1 --instance-type t2.nano --key-name sharique --subnet-id subnet-01b57d2958a671c6f --security-group-ids sg-09b61cdb1629cbbac --user-data file://script.txt --profile ttn-newers --region us-east-1 --associate-public-ip-address

6. Create a new volume with encryption in same az in which you launched your instance.
   attach the encrypted volume to your instance and copy data from unencrypted volume to
   encrypted volume.

7. Create a AMI of the that server and launch with a new key. or detach the EBS of that server and Create a new server with new and Attach that ebs to that newely created server.
